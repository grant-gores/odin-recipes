    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef sirloin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>8 slices applewood-smoked bacon</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>6 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>6 leaves lettuce</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together ground beef, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl until evenly blended. Form into six (4-inch-wide) patties and place on a large plate. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until slightly firm, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on a paper towel-lined plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until hot and slightly pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over patties about 1 minute before they are done.</li>
        <li>Mix together peanut butter and maple syrup in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat peanut butter mixture in the microwave until slightly runny, about 25 seconds. Stir until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread peanut butter mixture over hamburger buns. Place patties, lettuce, tomatoes, and bacon on the bottoms, then cover with top buns.</li>
    </ol>
